INFO Captsone Carbonet

## 1. Project Summary
Research has shown that over half of American households engage in gardening activities, with a rise of over 18.3 million new gardeners since the start of the pandemic. However, what has also been on the rise is global greenhouse gas emissions. Our solution is Carbonet â€“ a platform for gardening enthusiasts to share their knowledge and reduce their carbon footprints through home gardening. We believe that through our virtual, personalized trackers and community features, home gardeners can not only reach new milestones in gardening more efficiently, but can also make a measurable difference in combating global climate change.

## 2. For Future Teams
This project is running base on some local stored JSON data files. Future teams might consider develope a database for the website to store more plants and from different sources and user preference and information. Furthurmore, diagrams for tracking the net emission can be developed furthurmore into more intuitive ways for user to see their progress.
